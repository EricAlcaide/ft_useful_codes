# Files for the school project
This repository is plenty of useful codes about (Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning) written in Python. Codes are organised by topic (Classic AI, Modern ML, Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks, GA/NN and Reinforcement Learning). Alse a notebook for stock prices analysis is provided in the Stocks folder.

## Classic AI
Quick review of some famous classic AI algorithms such as Minimax with Alpha-Beta Prunning and Search Space Methods

## Modern ML
Some Machine Learning algorithms including both classification and regression problems. Examples: linear regression, perceptron, KNN, K-means...

## Tensorflow
Neural Networks against MNIST database. Shows the true power of Machine Learning using one of the best libraries ever.

## Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement Learning used against different games to prove learning and adaptability.

## Genetic Algorithms
Tools for optimization. Evolutionary algorithms.

## GA/NN
Combines the evolution of populations with their learning to create better individuals (learn faster, better accuracy...). FeedForward NeuralNets implemented in Keras and Tensorflow against MNIST and Cifar10.
